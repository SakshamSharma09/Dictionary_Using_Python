# Dictionary_Using_Python

This program demands a input from the user about the word he would like to find the meaning of. Based on the data it tries to define the word. 

The most striking feature is that if you make a spelling mistake related to the word it suggests you the most closest of the word similar to the typed word and then sasks you about the word whose meaning you want to find.

It does not focus on the Casing of the word.

If there are more than one definitions of the word it seperates it in multiple lines. So,it is user friendly also.

Have a look at the code.

Data_dict.json file contains the data about the meaning of the words. It is a very large dictionary database and used in the program.
